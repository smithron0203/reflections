How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

   By comparing the two versions a change can easily be identified

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    It will provide a better understanding of the flow and the introduced changes in the program

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

   pros : it allows to save a required change only rather than creating unwanted multiple files
   cons : If user forgets to commit change made will go unnoticed and debugging will cost time

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    Allowing multiple files to be saved in a single go helps in understanding the logical change that have
	made in the program.For eg. if a single change affects many files it is better to save all in one version
	and it will help in debugging.
How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    git log will give entire commit log with commit id and explanation about the change committed.
	git diff can be used to find the changes we have made between to commits by using git diff first_id second_id
	it will give the changes made between these two commits

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    Version control allows reverting back at any moment of time and provides great flexibility in making the 
	changes.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    To have a version control for the app I am going to develop
