When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    When I am working in a group and I have to update the changes made by me 
	in the main code, I should have a remote repository. So individual
	works can be updated anytime without affecting the flow
Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    Manual pulling rather than automatically updating is beneficial as it gives the 
	coder the power to control the syncing process.
Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

    Fork is used to clone a repository in GitHub into our GitHub acount.
	It has no connection to local repository.
	Clone is used to make a copy from GitHub to local machine.
	Branch is used to make branchout locally.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?

    It will avoid conflict while merging
