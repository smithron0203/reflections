When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    When I am working in a group and I have to update the changes made by me 
	in the main code, I should have a remote repository. So individual
	works can be updated anytime without affecting the flow
Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    Manual pulling rather than automatically updating is beneficial as it gives the 
	coder the power to control the syncing process.
